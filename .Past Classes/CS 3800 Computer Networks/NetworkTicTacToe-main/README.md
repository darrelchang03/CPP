# User Manual
First the server code file must be run, where it will output the serverâ€™s IP, which clients must connect to. Clients will take that IP and set that equal to their SERVER variable. The clients then run their clients. The last client to connect will go first, where they will input a number 1-9 to represent where they want to go. After each move the updated boards will be displayed. Players take turns until one wins or there is a tie.
