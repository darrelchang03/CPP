Answer: "Street Hawk" was developed for the ZX Spectrum home computer. A version for the Amstrad CPC computer was made and sold also in 1986. While they were selling, development for a version for the Commodore 64 was in progress. Due to ongoing delays in production, it was scrapped after 90% was completed already.
